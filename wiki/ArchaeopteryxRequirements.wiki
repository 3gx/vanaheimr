Enable *fast* simulation of future architectures on modern hardware.  

= Goals =

 * Functionally simulate a many-core processor using GPUs.
 * Constant slowdown factor when simulating a new processor on current generation hardware.
 * Make all components modular, with well defined interfaces, especially with regards to the ISA.
 * ISA and runtime extensions for data distributions and locality.
 * Lightweight and modular instrumentation or trace generation interface for interactions with timing models.

= Requirements =

 * Simulate complete CUDA applications.  As a starting point, simulate the PTX virtual machine (this may need revision).
 * A fast virtual machine IR and byte-code format.  Ideally, this should be loaded, and simulated in parallel.
 * Written completely in CUDA device code.  No host code at all for the simulator engine.

= Component List =
 * An IR and a byte-code format 
 * Processor simulator
  * Memory module
  * Core simulator
   * Instruction execution engine
 * Runtime
