#summary The evolving requirements document of the functional simulator

= Goals =

* Functionally simulate a many-core processor using GPUs.
* Constant slowdown factor when simulating a new processor on current generation hardware.
* Make all components modular, with well defined interfaces, especially with regards to the ISA.
* ISA and runtime extensions for data distributions and locality.
* Lightweight and modular instrumentation or trace generation interface for interactions with timing models.

= Requirements =

* Simulate complete CUDA applications.  As a starting point, simulate the PTX virtual machine (this made need revision).
* A fast virtual machine IR and bytecode format.  Ideally, this should be loaded, and simulated in parallel.
