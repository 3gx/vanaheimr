\section{Introduction}



This paper makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item It introduces a design methodology for simulating parallel processors
		that achieves near peak utilization of modern GPU accelerators and
		good scaling across three generations of GPUs.
		
	\item It shows that microarchitecture details, such as scratchpad sizes,
		hardware thread schedulers, register file organizations, cache
		hierarchies, and core pipelines can be simulated quickly as long as
		the hierarchical organization of the machine is maintained.
	
	\item 
\end{itemize}
