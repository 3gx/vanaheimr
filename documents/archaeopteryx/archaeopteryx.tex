\section{Introduction}

% attention grabber
The gap between parallel processor and simulator performance is widening with
each successive generation.  

% Performance modeling

% Functional modeling
This is even more troubling for functional verification.  Although most bugs are
still caught with relatively short directed tests~\cite{ref:bug-distributions},
a critical class of bugs only occurs during complex interactions between
multiple components.  These bugs are typically discovered through application
stress testing or random program execution.   As application complexity
continues to grow with processor capability, there is a rising concern that
simulator performance will limit application and random test coverage,
especially for applications with multiple phases.  

% Why are we doing this?
It would be desirable to leverage the tremendous growth in computing potential
provided by parallel processors for microarchitecture simulation.  However,
the sequential operation and tight dependency loops in high performance 
processor pipelines quickly dash those hopes.  

% Our approach
In this paper, we assert that the parallel and hierarchical organization of
microarchitecture structures used in modern processors provides a natural
basis for simulation using data-parallel algorithms.  We test this assertion by

% The result
To leverage technology scaling and microarchitecture enhancements of the
previous generation of hardware to simulate the next.

% Contributions
This paper makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item It describes the design of the first processor simulator implemented
		completely in the CUDA "C" language.

	\item It introduces a design methodology for simulating parallel processors
		that achieves near peak utilization of modern GPU accelerators and
		good scaling across three generations of GPUs.
		
	\item It shows that microarchitecture details, such as scratchpad sizes,
		hardware thread schedulers, register file organizations, cache
		hierarchies, and core pipelines can be simulated quickly as long as
		the hierarchical organization of the machine is maintained.
	
	\item It compares
